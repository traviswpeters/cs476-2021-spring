{:.titletext}
Information regarding our course and MSU's response to COVID-19
{:.subtitletext}

###### COURSE-SPECIFIC INFORMATION

- Office hours can be attended virtually by visiting my "Personal Room" on [WebEx](https://montana.webex.com/meet/w52k448).
- Feel free to schedule an alternative meeting time with me or the TA if you can't meet during regular office hours.
- We will primarily use our {{site.data.settings.slack}} workspace for discussions and questions about lectures, assignments, and so forth.  
  _(I may also make email announcements via our course mailing list.)_

###### MISC. HELPFUL LINKS
- The [MSU Bookstore has great resources available to faculty and students]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid19/msu_bookstore_covid19.pdf).
- MSU is maintaining a helpful page for students: [Students: Learn Anywhere](http://ato.montana.edu/learnanywhere/students/index-old.html).
- The [GSoC Student Success Center](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html) is still operating (virtually).

<!-- #### TL;DR -->
<!-- - Please **do not** come to class if you have a temperature or if you are not feeling well. If you haven't done so already, please contact your health provider. -->
<!-- - While we cannot require you to wear a mask in class, we ask that you do so out of respect to others around you. -->
<!-- - When you enter class and sit down at a seat, we recommend that you treat that seat/table as a contaminated. -->
<!-- - Please plan to bring your sanitation kit to class and wipe down your table before and after class. -->

<!-- We recently received guidance that [face coverings on all the campuses of the Montana University System are **_required_**](http://www.montana.edu/facultyexcellence/news/07-24-2020-COVID19guidance.html). -->

###### WEARING MASKS IN CLASSROOMS IS REQUIRED
Face coverings are required in all indoor spaces and all enclosed or partially enclosed outdoor spaces.
MSU requires all students to wear face masks or cloth face coverings in classrooms, laboratories and other similar spaces where in-person instruction occurs.
MSU requires the wearing of masks in physical classrooms to help mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.
The MSU community views the adoption of these practices as a mark of good citizenship and respectful care of fellow classmates, faculty, and staff.

The complete details about [MSU’s mask requirement](https://www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus/planning/roadmap/index.html#appendix-j) can be found at
[https://www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus/index.html](https://www.montana.edu/health/coronavirus/index.html).

These requirements from the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education are detailed in the
[MUS Healthy Fall 2020 Guidelines, Appendix B](https://www.mus.edu/coronavirus/Appendix%20B%20Face%20Covering%20Requirement.pdf).

Compliance with the face-covering protocol is expected.
If a you do not comply with a classroom rule, you may be requested to leave class.  
[Section 460.00 of the MSU Code of Student Conduct](https://www.montana.edu/policy/student_conduct/#460) covers "disruptive student behavior."

###### HEALTH-RELATED CLASS ABSENCES
Please evaluate your own health status regularly and refrain from attending class and other on-campus events if you are ill.
MSU students who miss class due to illness will be given opportunities to access course materials online.
(Recall the above description of how our course resources will be made to be accessible online.)
You are encouraged to seek appropriate medical attention for treatment of illness.
In the event of contagious illness, **please do not** come to class or to campus to turn in work.
Instead notify me by email about your absence as soon as practical, so that accommodations can be made.
Please note that documentation (a Doctor’s note) for medical excuses is **not required**.
MSU University Health Partners -
as part of their commitment to maintain patient confidentiality,
to encourage more appropriate use of healthcare resources, and
to support meaningful dialogue between instructors and students - does not provide such documentation.

###### ACCOMODATIONS FOR NOT WEARING A MASK
Individuals whose unique and individual circumstances require an exception to the face covering requirement,
as indicated by a medical professional, may request one in accordance with the campus ADA policies.
Students should contact the [Office of Disability Services (ODS)](www.montana.edu/disabilityservices) at 994-2824 or [drv@montana.edu](mailto:drv@montana.edu) to receive written permission from the Office of Disability Services at MSU.
It is strongly recommended that students make contact prior to arriving on campus in order to provide adequate time for their request to be evaluated.
