Find a recent/interesting research paper and write a review of the paper (2 pages max, single-spaced).

If you don't know where to start, I suggest skimming the websites and "programs" for conferences from recent years.

[IEEE SecDev (Secure Systems)](https://secdev.ieee.org/2020/Home) /
[PETS (Privacy Enhancing Technologies)](https://petsymposium.org).

- The title of the paper and when/where it was published.
