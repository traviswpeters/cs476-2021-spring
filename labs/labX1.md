## Objective

This assignment is meant to be a fun, low stakes way to get you thinking about threat modeling.
This assignment should also give you more practice with using tools like Git, GitHub, and Markdown.
For this assignment we'd like you to present a threat model and reflect on your approach.

1. Threat model **_leaving your laptop on a table in the SUB while you step away to take a phone call._**

   Please feel free to present your threat model in textual or graphical form (or a combination of both).
   Please **describe your approach** (e.g., free-form brainstorming, scenario-based brainstorming, asset-centric brainstorming).
   We don't expect that you would use a formal approach to threat modeling, such as STRIDE, but we do want to understand your approach.
   If you want to go beyond simple brainstorming, consider reading up a bit more on other resources and strategies such as
   [Attack Trees](https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1999/12/attack_trees.html)
   or attack libraries such as
   [CAPEC](http://capec.mitre.org) or
   [OWASP's Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/),
   or [OWASP Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html).
2. (Reflection) What are the **strengths** of your approach?
3. (Reflection) What are the **weaknesses** of your approach?
4. (Reflection) What might you improve about your threat model and/or approach in the future?
